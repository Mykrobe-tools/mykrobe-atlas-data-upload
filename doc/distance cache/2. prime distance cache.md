From last step, you will have a file that contains one curl requests per line. Run this file
in shell and log the output from its execution:
```
bsub -e curl-dev.e -o curl-dev.o "bash dev.sample.nearest.neighbours.cache.curls \"<access_token>\" > out.dev.curls 2> err.dev.curls"
```
**Note that you will need to provide access token to call Atlas API.**

###Troubleshooting

If you are lucky, all the curl requests will go through successfully. In response, the Atlas
API send a success response with a json body that indicate the calls were successful. These
responses will be logged in the `out.dev.curls` file as above.

But quite often you may encounter errors due to various reasons. Under these circumstances, you
may receive a html response which states the error. **Note that** these errors are also logged
in the same output file.

You can follow the following steps to extract the curl requests that has not gone through and
make these curl requests again:
```
# Get the line numbers of failed requests
grep -v '<' out.dev.curls | grep -nv 'success' | awk -F ":" '{print $1}' > out.dev.curls.linenumber

# Get the curl commands from these line numbers
awk 'NR==FNR{linesToPrint[$0];next} FNR in linesToPrint' out.dev.curls.linenumber dev.sample.nearest.neighbours.cache.curls > dev.curls.fix1

# Make the failed calls again
bsub -e curl-dev-fix1.e -o curl-dev-fix1.o "bash dev.curls.fix1 \"<access_token>\" > out.dev.curls.fix1 2> err.dev.curls.fix1"
```
