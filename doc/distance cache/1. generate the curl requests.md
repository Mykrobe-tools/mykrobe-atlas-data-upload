At this point, you would have generated samples' nearest neighbours through scripts from
`mykrobe-atlas-distance-data` repository. Also you would have calculated each sample's
nearest leaf through scripts in the same repository.

The aim of this step is to generate curl requests whose request body will contain the distance
results that Atlas API will accept and cache. You will need these four pieces of information:

- path to the sample id mapping from the target platform
- path to the file which stores samples' nearest leaf results
- path to the file which stores samples' nearest neighbours results
- the host of Atlas API on the target platform, e.g.: https://api-dev.mykro.be

A script has been developed to generate curl requests based on above information:
```
bsub -e generate-curls.e -o generate-curls.o "python3 bin/generate_sample_nearest_neighbours_cache_curl_requests.py dev.sample.mapping.csv /path/to/nearest_leaf /path/to/nearest_neighbours https://api-dev.mykro.be > dev.sample.nearest.neighbours.cache.curls"
```

Note that in the output generated from above execution, each line contains an `echo` command
which pipe the request body into `curl` command. This is to avoid `Argument list too long`
issue that `curl` may complain if the request body is too large.
