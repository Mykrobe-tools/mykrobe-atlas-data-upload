You may wonder why we need this section.

We store the genotype calls for each existing samples in a redis server so that
when a new sample is processed, the distance calculation can be based on the
genotype call of the new sample and those of the existing samples.

We also store the genotype calls for each leaf node on the phylogenetic tree so
that when a new sample is processed, a nearest leaf node can be found through
distance calculation based on the genotype call of the new sample and those of
the leaf nodes on the phylogenetic tree.
