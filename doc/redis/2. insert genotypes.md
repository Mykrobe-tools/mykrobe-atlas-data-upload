Once the genotypes file is ready from step 1 in this section, we should upload
it to a pod that would use python.

For example:
```shell
KUBECONFIG=config.yml kubectl cp redis.dev.sample.genotypes <namespace>/<pod>>:/fullpath/
```

Then run:
```shell
python3 bin/insert-sample-genotypes-into-redis.py > out.insert &
```

For first time only or any other time that the phylogenetic tree has been changed,
we will need to insert the genotypes for the tree leaves into the redis server.
```shell
KUBECONFIG=config.yml kubectl cp tree-leaf-genotype-calls <namespace>/<pod>>:/fullpath/
```
