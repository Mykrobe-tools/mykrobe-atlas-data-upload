This section of work will prepare the data necessary for serving the minimum spanning tree of a sample's
nearest neighbours. The idea is to store in a cache database for each sample's nearest neighbours with
all the distances between any pair of them.

Start from the distance matrix that we use for populating the Distance API, we first extract the clustered
neighbours for each sample and store the distances within a threshold (e.g. 10) for the cluster. Second we
add the information to a key value store for easy access.

To serve the minimum spanning tree for the cluster in which a sample is associated with, we first retrieve
the clustered neighbours and the distances from the cache database. Then we run minimum spanning tree algorithm
on the dataset. An example implementation could be found in `bin/query_mst.py`:
```shell
bsub -e query7.e -o query7.o "singularity exec berkeleydb-latest.simg python3 /usr/src/app/bin/query_mst.py your_sample_name /path/to/berkeleydb_clustered_neighbours_distance"
```
