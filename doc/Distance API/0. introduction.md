At this point, you would have generated distance matrix for the sample-sample distance
and another distance matrix for the sample-tree distance.

The distance data is served from Distance API. There are two ways you can upload the
distance data to the Distance API:

- through Distance API REST interface
- through `cypher-shell` to directly interact with the Neo4j database

For performance reason, I am going to show you how to upload the distance data via
`cypher-shell`. This will allow you to upload the data in minutes even if you have
tens of thousands samples and tens of millions neighbourhood relationships to create.
