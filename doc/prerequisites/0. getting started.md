Hello, this is the starting point of data upload journey. I wish you good luck.

At this point, you would have processed samples and generated a BIGSI index as well as
distance matrix. It is time to upload these data to the Kubernetes hosted applications
(e.g. BIGSI API and distance API).

It is assumed that you have data to upload for a list of samples. Let's call it
`included_samples` from now on.

**It is important to make sure the following assumptions are true:**

- BIGSI index contains only samples from `included_samples`
- All `included_samples` are included in BIGSI index
- Distance matrix includes data for all `included_samples`
