The uploading process documented here assumes there exists a `included_samples` list and
there may exist a `excluded_samples` list. However, the `excluded_samples` is optional
throughout the scripts. So all the scripts should work with either with or without the
`excluded_samples` list.

I have been repeating it a few times, but I want to stress again, the `excluded_samples`
is **optional**.

But if there exists an `excluded_samples` list, please prepare a text file that contains
the isolate ids of these `excluded_samples`, one id per line.

###Preparing `included_samples`

There are many ways to compile an `included_samples` list. Once you have the isolate ids
for the `included_samples`, please write them to a text file, one id per line.

To give an example, one way to create the `included_samples` file is to extract the samples
from the BIGSI build file:
```
awk -F "\t" '{print $2}' /nfs/leia/research/iqbal/projects/mykrobeatlas/pilot/absorb_cryptic/build_files/new_single_bf.tsv | sed -e 's/,/\n/g' > included_samples
```
